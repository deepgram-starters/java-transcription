### Install dependencies

Install the project dependencies in the root directory. You will see a `target` folder created with the compiled classes.

```bash
mvn compile
```

### Edit the config file

Copy the text from `.env-sample` and create a new file called `.env`. Paste in the code and enter your API key you generated in the [Deepgram console](https://console.deepgram.com/).

```bash
port=8080
deepgram_api_key=api_key
```

### Run the application

Once running, you can [access the application in your browser](http://localhost:8080/).
